                        <p>During the era of Print Design, companies would approach agencies for a brand identity
                            system.
                            The
                            identity work started with a simple logo and colour scheme and then scaled to business
                            cards,
                            product
                            packaging, vehicles and more. The sum of these components made up the physical brand.

                        <p>Building
                            webpages
                            is not so different. The old PSD-to-HTML workflow served us well for many years, but
                            isn’t able
                            to stand
                            in the face of all the complexity that responsive web design and the multi-device web
                            have
                            introduced.
                            Internal processes have changed. Likewise, how we craft webpages and what we deliver to
                            our
                            clients must
                            mature.</p>


                        <h2>Modules, not pages</h2>
                        <p>
                            The traditional way to handle complexity in programming is to break large complex things
                            into smaller well-formed “modules”. Focusing on creating healthy front-end modules instead
                            of complete
                            pages can help break complex page layouts into reusable solutions. The <a
                                href="./home.html">homepage</a> of this website is a good example of this.
                        </p>

                        <p>From the exterior, it may appear to be a single page but the homepage is actually comprised
                            of Lego®-like building blocks designed to be combined together. The look and feel of new
                            components like form controls, navigation, and carousels are informed by the colours and
                            type
                            that define the brand.</p>

                        <p>The highlight component, for example, can be re-purposed and “themed” in the news section
                            using a simple CSS class. While they are different visually, they possess the same
                            underlying code structure. All these components are then strung together to create complete
                            page layouts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Working on isolated components made the iteration process faster as well. Faster and more
                            reusable means that the work the Digital Center of Excellence [DCOE] performed resulted
                            greater value for the company.
                        </p>

                        <h2>On Code</h2>
                        <p>Whether it’s CSS for a single component or an entire site, I finish in a mobile-first fashion
                            by using min-width media queries to set the smallest view and move outward from there.
                            However, I start much differently. I begin with wide views because the layout is usually
                            more complex. I find it easier to ensure columns and spacing are set wide and work my way
                            down to a single column.</p>

                        <p>All my values are relative (em, rem, etc.) and based on the 100% 16px base, so I can move
                            code around without losing proportion. As I continue to fidget with various layouts, I
                            shuffle code for larger views down into alternate media queries as needed. I’m not saying
                            this is the most efficient practice, but at the end of a project this somehow helps me feel
                            like every view has been well considered, which is most important to me.</p>
