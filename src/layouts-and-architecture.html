                        <h1>Layout &amp; Architecture</h1>
                        <p>Attends layouts, based on bootstraps structure and grid, encourage consistency across
                            platforms, environments, and screen sizes by using uniform elements and spacing.</p>

                        <h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>
                        <h3>Predictable</h3>
                        <p>UIs should use intuitive and predictable layouts, with consistent user interaction regions
                            and spatial organization.</p>

                        <h3>Consistent</h3>
                        <p>Layouts should use a consistent grid, keylines, and padding.</p>

                        <h3>Responsive</h3>
                        <p>Layouts are adaptive and react to input from the user, device, and screen elements.</p>

                        <h3>Structure</h3>
                        <p>Attends layouts are visually balanced. Most measurements align to an 8px based grid applied,
                            which aligns both spacing and the overall layout.
                            Smaller components, such as iconography and typography, can align to a 4px based grid.</p>


                        <h2>Grid</h2>

                        <h3>Responsive layout grid</h3>
                        <p>The Adobe experience Manager responsive layout grid adapts to screen size and orientation,
                            ensuring consistency across layouts.</p>


                        <h3>Columns</h3>

                        <p>Content is placed in the areas of the screen that contain columns.</p>

                        <p>Column width is defined using percentages, rather than fixed values, to allow content to
                            flexibly adapt to any screen size. The number of columns displayed in the grid is determined
                            by the breakpoint range (a range of predetermined screen sizes) at which a screen is viewed,
                            whether it’s a breakpoint for mobile, tablet, or another size.</p>


                        <h3>Gutters</h3>
                        <p>Gutters are the spaces between columns. They help separate content. Gutter widths are fixed
                            values at each breakpoint range. To better adapt to the screen, gutter width can change at
                            different breakpoints. Wider gutters are more appropriate for larger screens, as they create
                            more whitespace between columns.</p>

                        <h3>Margins</h3>
                        <p>Margins are the space between content and the left and right edges of the screen.
                            Margin widths are defined as fixed values at each breakpoint range. To better adapt to the
                            screen, the margin width can change at different breakpoints. Wider margins are more
                            appropriate for larger screens, as they create more whitespace around the perimeter of
                            content.</p>


                        <h2>Themes</h2>
                        <p>Themes are used to customize component styles to fit the specific aesthetic of a brand or
                            product.</p>

                        <h3>Theming basics</h3>
                        <p>Themes are used to modify existing components to fit a specific visual style. By using
                            Attends’ variables, developers can easily customize all of their components by changing a
                            set of universal style values, eliminating the need to modify individual components.</p>

                        <h3>Customising a theme</h3>
                        <p>The default theme acts as a starting point; from there designers and developers can define
                            how their own components and styles deviate from the default. Altering one, some, or all of
                            the default variable values will result in a new theme. The developer then packages those
                            new values into a new theme SCSS stylesheet which will replace the values of the default
                            theme.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Variables</h3>
                        <p>
                            With variables, the code only needs to be changed in one place to see the effect
                            system-wide. Variables are used across all components and help keep global patterns and
                            styles consistent.
                            Typography, Iconography, colors, sizing, spacing, shaping and grid patterns are all
                            customizable variables that we allow to change, although there are other styles that can be
                            changed depending on the complexity of the components in cause.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Styling your theme - Basics</h3>
                        <p>
                            To start customizing your theme, you’ll need to modify the variables in your project’s
                            general.scss file. By default, each theme starts off with Attends’ baseline values. We’ve
                            added these values in the theme so you can easily swap them out.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Typography</h3>
                        <p>
                            To change your theme’s typography, we recommend using Google Fonts and choosing a
                            font-family that best reflects your style. You will understand how to import and style fonts
                            on our components document.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            Shape</h3>
                        <p>
                            To systematically apply shape throughout your general styles, it helps to understand that
                            components are grouped by size into categories of small, medium, and large. Each component
                            size group can be themed by overriding the default values.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Color</h3>
                        <p>
                            To change your theme’s color scheme, replace the default HEX color values with custom HEX
                            color values.
                        </p>

                        <p>You can also find out more about customizing our themes on our Web components documentation
                            to add and personalize existing style. </p>

                        <h2>Spacing</h2>
                        <p>Spacing is an important — and often overlooked — part of visual design. Attends UI/UX Guide
                            takes a lot of the guesswork out of spacing to help designers and developers deliver clear,
                            functional layouts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Consistent spacing creates visual balance that makes the user interface (UI) easier for
                            Customers to navigate. Apply consistent spacing to improve the quality of the UI.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The spacing system</h3>
                        <p>All spacing for components and typography is done in increments of 4 pixels. This 4px value
                            forms the basic unit of measurement for spacing.</p>
