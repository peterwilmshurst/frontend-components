                                    <p>Layouts are adaptive and react to input from the user, device, and screen

                <h3>Structure</h3>
                <p>DCoE layouts are visually balanced and can be used to create consistent spacing with typography and
                    other page elements. Most measurements apply to a 16px based grid whilst smaller components, such as
                    iconography and typography, can align to a 4px based grid.</p>

                <h1>TO DO!!!!</h1>
                <h2>Grid</h2>

                <h3>Responsive layout grid</h3>
                <p>The Adobe experience Manager responsive layout grid adapts to screen size and orientation,
                    ensuring consistency across layouts.</p>

                <img src="./img/dcoe/responsive-layout-grid.svg" alt="Responsive Layout Grid" class="img-fluid">


                <h3>Columns</h3>

                <p>Content is placed in the areas of the screen that contain columns.</p>

                <p>Column width is defined using percentages, rather than fixed values, to allow content to
                    flexibly adapt to any screen size. The number of columns displayed in the grid is determined
                    by the breakpoint range (a range of predetermined screen sizes) at which a screen is viewed,
                    whether it’s a breakpoint for mobile, tablet, or another size.</p>


                <h3>Gutters</h3>
                <p>Gutters are the spaces between columns. They help separate content. Gutter widths are fixed
                    values at each breakpoint range. To better adapt to the screen, gutter width can change at
                    different breakpoints. Wider gutters are more appropriate for larger screens, as they create
                    more whitespace between columns.</p>

                <h3>Margins</h3>
                <p>Margins are the space between content and the left and right edges of the screen.
                    Margin widths are defined as fixed values at each breakpoint range. To better adapt to the
                    screen, the margin width can change at different breakpoints. Wider margins are more
                    appropriate for larger screens, as they create more whitespace around the perimeter of
                    content.</p>

                <h1>TO DO!</h1>
                <h2>Themes</h2>
                <p>Themes are used to customize component styles to fit the specific aesthetic of a brand or
                    product.</p>

                <h3>Theming basics</h3>
                <p>Themes are used to modify existing components to fit a specific visual style. By using
                    Attends’ variables, developers can easily customize all of their components by changing a
                    set of universal style values, eliminating the need to modify individual components.</p>

                <h3>Customising a theme</h3>
                <p>The default theme acts as a starting point; from there designers and developers can define
                    how their own components and styles deviate from the default. Altering one, some, or all of
                    the default variable values will result in a new theme. The developer then packages those
                    new values into a new theme SCSS stylesheet which will replace the values of the default
                    theme.
                </p>

                <h3>Variables</h3>
                <p>
                    With variables, the code only needs to be changed in one place to see the effect
                    system-wide. Variables are used across all components and help keep global patterns and
                    styles consistent.
                    Typography, Iconography, colors, sizing, spacing, shaping and grid patterns are all
                    customizable variables that we allow to change, although there are other styles that can be
                    changed depending on the complexity of the components in cause.
                </p>

                <h3>Styling your theme - Basics</h3>
                <p>
                    To start customizing your theme, you’ll need to modify the variables in your project’s
                    general.scss file. By default, each theme starts off with Attends’ baseline values. We’ve
                    added these values in the theme so you can easily swap them out.
                </p>

                <h3>Typography</h3>
                <p>
                    To change your theme’s typography, we recommend using Google Fonts and choosing a
                    font-family that best reflects your style. You will understand how to import and style fonts
                    on our components document.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Shape</h3>
                <p>
                    To systematically apply shape throughout your general styles, it helps to understand that
                    components are grouped by size into categories of small, medium, and large. Each component
                    size group can be themed by overriding the default values.
                </p>

                <h3>Color</h3>
                <p>
                    To change your theme’s color scheme, replace the default HEX color values with custom HEX
                    color values.
                </p>

                <p>You can also find out more about customizing our themes on our Web components documentation
                    to add and personalize existing style. </p>

                <h2>Spacing</h2>
                <p>Spacing is an important — and often overlooked — part of visual design. This UI/UX Guide takes a lot
                    of the guesswork out of spacing to help designers and developers deliver clear, functional layouts.
                </p>
                <p>Consistent spacing creates visual balance that makes the user interface (UI) easier for customers to
                    navigate. It is important to apply consistent spacing to improve the quality of the UI.</p>

                <h3>The spacing system</h3>
                <p>All spacing for components and typography is done in increments of 4 pixels. This 4px value forms the
                    basic unit of measurement for spacing.</p>
                <p>Typography doesn’t use a traditional baseline grid. Instead, line heights are set in increments of
                    4px and spacing is measured from the edges of the text boxes.</p>
                <p>Many elements are sized in increments of 20px to match the line height of body text. This makes it
                    easy to create clear and harmonious layouts.</p>

                <p>For example, the standard size of the avatar element has been chosen to match the line height of the
                    body text.</p>

                <h3>How to choose spacing</h3>
                <p>Use less space between small components, or components that share a close functional relationship.
                </p>
                <p>Use more space between large components, or between components which are less functionally related.
                </p>
                <p>Coordinate small and large values, along with structural components like cards, to create visual
                    groupings of related things. This will help customers understand the interface and make it easier
                    for them to find what they are looking for.</p>
                <p>For screens with specialized layouts, adjust overall spacing based on the density of the content. For
                    example, a simple login screen on desktop display has more room to breathe, so more space can be
                    used.</p>
