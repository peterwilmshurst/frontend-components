                    <p>Understand how you can use brand colors and style to customise your layouts.</p>

                    <h2 id="voice-and-tone">1. Voice and tone</h2>

                    <h3>What is voice and tone?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our voice is a reflection of who we are. We should always sound like ourselves. Our tone adapts
                        appropriately to the context and situation. The best way to decide what tone to use is to ask
                        yourself what customers are likely feeling when they encounter your message so you can decide
                        how to
                        respond.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For example, when Customers make a purchase for the first time, they might be feeling excited,
                        accomplished, and maybe a little bit unsure of what to do next. We can respond to this by
                        congratulating them and giving them the information they need to process their order.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When customers encounter an error message, they might be feeling anxious, stressed out, and that
                        in
                        90% of times results in drop from the purchase. We can respond to this by stating what went
                        wrong
                        and giving clear direction about how to resolve the problem. We never want to use a negative
                        tone
                        because we are here to help people.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Voice guidelines</h3>


                    <p>Voice is the foundation for communicating about our products and delivering brand messages. For
                        example at Attends, our voice expresses the core of our personality, while bringing comfort,
                        confidence, freedom, dignity and a sense of connection to our users. Through careful use of the
                        Attends voice, we help empower users to meet their personal goals and ease their life’s
                        frustrations.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Tone Approach</h3>

                    <p>Tone conveys an attitude towards both the subject matter and the reader. All content – whether
                        it’s
                        introductory text on the UI, an error message, or a blog post – tells part of a bigger story.
                        Good
                        storytellers are skilled in two main areas: what they are saying (the substantive content) and
                        how
                        to say it to any given audience (the style and tone in which it is presented). Be a good
                        storyteller.
                    </p>


                    <h2 id="typography">2. Typography</h2>

                    <h3>Make Your UI Reader-Friendly</h3>
                    <p>In the case of Attends, we are working to improve mature and elder people’s lives so, enhanced
                        readability is crucial when capturing our audience. Custom web design for senior citizens can be
                        achieved by following best practices such as designing with larger UI design elements, using
                        contrasting colors and most important of all have balanced font sizing and weight, to help
                        highlight
                        important content. It is also important to perform appropriate user testing regularly.</p>

                    <div class="typography-example">
                        <h1>Headline H1</h1>

                    <h2 id="colours">3. Colours</h2>
                    <h3>Colour Anatomy</h3>
                    <p>Attends default themes are derived from the Attends US design language color palette. The gray
                        color
                        family is dominant in the default themes, making use of subtle shifts in value to help organize
                        content into distinct zones.</p>

                    <p>The core blue color family serves as the primary action color across all Attends products and
                        experiences. Additional colors are used sparingly and purposefully.</p>


                    <img src="./img/dcoe/colour-anatomy.svg" alt="Color Anatomy" class="img-fluid">

                    <h3>Gradients</h3>
                    <p>These gradient variations are meant to serve as solutions for any different scenarios and
                        applications. The core blue and gray color gradients can be used in special cases for
                        backgrounds,
                        buttons and call to actions.</p>

                    <h3>Focus on the Target</h3>
                    <p>Remember the voice and tone we discussed earlier? With that in mind, make sure each of the images
                        you
                        choose reflect those values. Define the colors and tones across all photos you choose with the
                        pattern in mind. Whatever the culture, race, ethnic background or religion, the imagery tone
                        needs
                        to be similar and more important, transmit expressiveness and spontaneity.</p>

                    <img src="./img/dcoe/focus-on-the-target.png" alt="Focus on the target" class="img-fluid">

                    <h3>Image Patterns</h3>

                    <p>In the case of Domtar Personal Care whose mission statement is:</p>
                    <p>Personal Care is not just a business, it’s a mission. Absorbent hygiene solutions improve quality
                        of
                        life for millions of people around the world. We champion health, dignity and comfort through
                        what
                        we make and how we work. - Because for us, it’s personal.</p>

                    <p>Based on this statement the image pattern would reflect keywords such as:<br />
                        Dignity, independence, joviality, healthy, mature, active, spontaneous, clean, light and happy
                        environment, special moments, casual, multicultural, confidence, loveliness, emotive.</p>

                    <h3>Images in use</h3>

                    <p>When choosing an image to be used on our websites you must have certain considerations in mind.
                        What’s the message you want to tell? Who are you telling it to? How do they connect with your
                        message? are the first questions you have to ask yourself.</p>

                    <p>After that, think of the technical needs and restrictions:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Is it a banner, an article post or a card? Or could it be all of them?</li>
                        <li>You need to consider the action area, the safe area and where the call to action should go.
                        </li>
                        <li>Have in mind the multiple screen sizes that will display the image and ensure it works
                            accordingly.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Usage in banners</h3>

                    <img src="./img/dcoe/images-in-banners.svg" alt="Image usage in banners" class="img-fluid">

                    <p>Whenever you need to use Images on a banner, we always advise choosing backgrounds that
                        distinguish
                        areas for CTA readability (see above). It is also advised to have the major focus of the image
                        on
                        either the right or left side of the banner in order to leave enough space for title, text and
                        CTA
                        button.</p>
                    <p>Although we don’t advise it, for exceptional cases a semi-transparent background can be used for
                        the
                        CTA area. The banner image should work well accross desktop, tablet and mobile screens. And
                        always
                        remember, quality is a distinguisher between a good and a bad product so, we always advise to
                        use
                        images at twice the size (@2x - retina display). You can either use file formats in .JPEG or
                        .PNG,
                        where the latter might have transparent areas, but bear in mind the constraints of the
                        component.

                    <h3>Find the perfect images. Where, when and how?</h3>

                    <p><i>Almost 2/3 (two thirds) of the population affirms to be visual learners, and it’s proven
                            that adding images to accompany information increases people’s retention of said
                            information in their memory after three days from 10% to 65%. - Source:
                            stockphotos.com</i></p>

                    <p>Whether your message is simple or complex, first you need your image to capture the public at
                        first
                        glance. You need to catch their attention and lure them in and interest them in coming to see
                        what
                        you are offering. In order to do that, with the consistency we suggest on multiple sections of

                    <h3>Usage in Cards</h3>

                    <div class="row">

                        <div class="col-md-6">

                        </div>

                        <div class="col-md-6">

                            <p>When using images be aware of the card component’s style guidelines and ensure you
                                respect brand
                                tones and image patterns.</p>

                            <p>The image should align with the top and sides of the card and its proportions should be
                                4x3.5
                                with
                                relation to the size of the card or the column’s width.</p>

                            <p>For example a 3 column layout would mean each card’s width equals 440px therefore the
                                image
                                should be
                                440x390px. We also recommend exporting images with twice the regular size for retina
                                displays
                                with

                    <h2 id="iconography">5. Iconograpy</h2>

                    <p>Icons are visual symbols used to represent ideas, objects, or actions. They communicate messages
                        at a glance, afford interactivity, and draw attention to important information.</p>

                    <h3>Usage for designers</h3>
                    <p>The UI icons that appear within Attends components are generally 16px squares, however icons
                        sized at 20px, 24px, 32px and 36px can be also used within the UI. Icons should only be used
                        at their original sizes and not resized in code unless they are exported in .SVG file type,
                        a powerful vector format that allows multiple resizing without losing quality nor
                        resolution.</p>

                        Attends icons themselves do not have interaction states, only their backgrounds do.</p>

                        As
                        such, the absorbency process represents the main focus of our core technologies which can be
                        identified as a progress curve from wet to dry. The basis for this is an animation curve:
                        inspired
                        by the core technologies performance of our absorbent products, it is based on a powerful
                        absorption
                        at the start and a fast drying at the end.</p>
