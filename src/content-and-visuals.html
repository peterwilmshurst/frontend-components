                        <h2 id="voice-and-tone">Voice and tone</h2>
                        <h3>What is voice and tone?</h3>
                        <p>Attends’ voice is a reflection of who we are. We should always sound like Attends. Our tone
                            adapts appropriately to the context and situation. The best way to decide what tone to use
                            is to ask yourself what customers are likely feeling when they encounter your message so you
                            can decide how to respond.</p>

                        <p>For example, when Customers make a purchase for the first time, they might be feeling
                            excited, accomplished, and maybe a little bit unsure of what to do next. We can respond to
                            this by congratulating them and giving them the information they need to process their
                            order.</p>

                        <p>When customers encounter an error message, they might be feeling anxious, stressed out, and
                            that in 90% of times results in drop from the purchase. We can respond to this by stating
                            what went wrong and giving clear direction about how to resolve the problem. We never want
                            to use a negative tone because we are here to help people.</p>

                        <h3>Voice guidelines</h3>
                        <p>
                            Voice is the foundation for communicating about Attends products and delivering brand
                            messages. At Attends, our voice expresses the core of our personality, while bringing
                            comfort, Confidence, freedom, dignity and a sense of connection to our users. Through
                            careful use of the Attends voice, we help empower users to meet their personal goals and
                            ease their life’s frustrations.</p>


                        <h3>Tone Approach</h3>

                        <p>Tone conveys an attitude toward both the subject matter and the reader. All content – whether
                            it’s introductory text on the UI, an error message, or a topic in the docs – tells part of a
                            bigger story. Good storytellers are skilled in two main areas: what they are saying (the
                            substantive content) and how to say it to any given audience (the style and tone in which it
                            is presented). Be a good storyteller.</p>

                        <h2>Typography</h2>

                        <h3>Make Your UI Reader-Friendly</h3>
                        <p>Remember, we are working to improve mature and elder people’s lives so, enhanced readability
                            is crucial when capturing our audience. Custom web design for senior citizens can be
                            achieved by following best practices such as designing with larger UI design elements, using
                            contrasting colors and most important of all have balanced font sizing and weight, to help
                            highlight important content and performing appropriate user testing.</p>

                        <p>PETER ADD HEADERS HERE? SHOULD THEY GO INTO A EDITABLE CONTENT DIV?</p>

                        <h2>Colours</h2>
                        <h3>Colour Anatomy</h3>
                        <p>Attends default themes are derived from the Attends US Design Language color palette. The
                            Gray family is dominant in the default themes, making use of subtle shifts in value to help
                            organize content into distinct zones.
                        </p>

                        <p>The core Blue family serves as the primary action color across all Attends products and
                            experiences. Additional colors are used sparingly and purposefully.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Gradients</h3>
                        <p>These gradient variations are meant to serve as solutions for any different scenarios and
                            applications. The core Blue and Gray serve special cases in backgrounds, buttons and call to
                            actions.</p>

                        <h2>Images</h2>
                        <p>Remember the voice and tone we discussed earlier? With that in mind, make sure you translate
                            the images you choose into an illustration of those values. Define the colors and tones
                            across any photos you choose with the pattern in mind. Whatever the culture, race, ethnic
                            background or religion, the imagery tone needs to be similar and more important, transmit
                            expressiveness and spontaneity.</p>

                        <h3>Image Patterns</h3>

                        <p>As stated in our mission, “it’s Personal”, it’s about caring for loved ones, it’s about those
                            that can’t help themselves and most important, preserving dignity and independence easier
                            for the day-to-day people.</p>

                        <p>So, based on these values our image patterns can be translated to keywords such:
                            Dignity, Independence, Joviality, Healthy, Mature, Active, Spontaneous, Clean, Light and
                            Happy environment, special moments, Casual, multicultural, confidence, loveliness, poetic.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Images in use</h3>

                        <p>When choosing an image to be used on our websites you must have certain considerations in
                            mind.
                            What’s the message you want to pass? Who are you telling it to? How do they connect with
                            your message? are the first questions you have to ask yourself.</p>

                        <p>After that, think of the technical needs and restrictions:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Is it a banner, an article post or a card/tombstone? Or could it be all of them?</li>
                            <li>Depending on the decision on point 1. you need to consider the action area, the safe
                                area and where the call to action should go.</li>
                            <li>Have in mind the multiple screen sizes that will have the image on and make sure you
                                cover those when choosing.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Usage in banners</h3>
                        <p>Whenever you need to use Images on a banner, we always advise choosing backgrounds that
                            distinguish areas for CTA readability (see above). It is also advised to have the major
                            focus of the image on either the right or left side of the banner in order to leave enough
                            space for title, text and CTA button.</p>

                        <p>Although we don’t advise it, for exceptional cases a 90% opacity white or Attends blue text
                            box can be used as foreground behind the CTA area. Also have in mind the responsiveness that
                            has to be attended. The image should work well either in Desktop, Tablet or Mobile screens.
                            And always remember, quality is a distinguisher between a good and a bad product so, we
                            always advise to have these sizes and a doubled size version for each screen (@2x). You can
                            either use file formats in .JPEG or .PNG, where the second one might have transparent areas,
                            but bear in mind the constrains the component might have.</p>

                        <p>You can find more about banners and sliders sizes and alignments on the Carousel area of our
                            components section.</p>

                        <h3>Find the perfect images. Where, when and how?</h3>

                        <p><i>Almost 2/3 (two thirds) of the population affirms to be visual learners, and it’s proven
                                that adding images to accompany information increases people’s retention of said
                                information in their memory after three days from 10% to 65%. - Source:

                        <p>Whether your message is simple or complex, first you need your image to capture the public at
                            first glance. You need to catch their attention and lure them in and interest them in coming
                            to see what you are offering. In order to do that with the consistency we suggest on
                            multiple sections of this documet, the Digital COE selected a global partner to help you not
                            only find the right fit for your need but also keep everything tighdy with the rest of the

                        <h3>Usage in Cards</h3>
                        <p>When using images for cards/tombstones like Featured Pages, Articles and Products, file
                            formats can be used as JPEGs or PNGs. Be aware of the Card template style guidelines, in
                            order to build proper layouts respecting brand tones and image patterns.</p>

                        <p>The image should align with the top and sides of the card and its proportions should be
                            4x3.5, so whatever the size of the card or the column’s width.</p>

                        <p>For example: for a 3 column split the card would have 440px width and so the Image would be
                            440x390px. We also recommend exporting images with twice the regular size for retina
                            displays with the convention naming of i.e. “image-name@2x.jpg”.</p>

                        <p>In case you have a 2 column split screen, we advise to, in case you have 3 tombstones, divide
                            the grid in two vertical cards followed by a third one horizontal.
                            Find more about Cards and Tombstones at the components section of this document.</p>

                        <h2 id="iconography">Iconograpy</h2>

                        <p>Attends’ icons are visual symbols used to represent ideas, objects, or actions. They
                            communicate messages at a glance, afford interactivity, and draw attention to important
                            information. They draw from details found in the Gotham typeface and work well at small
                            sizes.</p>

                        <h3>Usage for designers</h3>
                        <p>The UI icons that appear within Attends components are generally 16px squares, however icons
                            sized at 20px, 24px, 32px and 36px can be also used within the UI. Icons should only be used
                            at their original sizes and not resized in code unless they are exported in .SVG file type,
                            a powerful vector format that allows multiple resizing without losing quality nor
                            resolution.</p>

                        <h4>Touch Targets</h4>
                        <p>All touch targets for interactive icons need to be 42px or larger. Developers can add padding
                            to a touch target with CSS to meet the 42px requirement.</p>

                        <h4>Color</h4>

                        <p>Icons are always a solid, monochromatic or double colored and need to pass the same color
                            contrast ratio as typography. The color of the icon should reflect the importance of the
                            icon’s action which should always be to help guide a user. It’s also important to note that
                            Attends icons themselves do not have interaction states, only their backgrounds do.</p>

                        <h4>Alignment</h4>
                        <p>When used next to text, icons should be center-aligned.</p>

                        <h3>Usage for Developers</h3>
                        <p>Although PNG and JPEG formats can be used, we advise the SVG use approach due to the
                            responsiveness of being a vector file and the capacity of higher performance and less
                            loading time. Also, there are two ways of working with SVGs, either as a single file icon or
                            as a sprite of icons in a file. This last one is the best option when it comes down to
                            maximizing performance.
                            An SVG image sprite is an SVG file containing multiple images (e.g., icons). Unlike SVG
                            symbols (more on this technique later), the images included in an SVG sprite are distributed
                            in a grid.</p>

                        <p>Combining more images in a single file is a performance booster, as opposed to creating a
                            different file for each image. The main reason being a reduction of the HTTP requests.
                            Reducing HTTP requests, in combo with a caching system for your assets, allows your users to
                            download images in no time!</p>
